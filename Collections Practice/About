This is a part of assignment of "Advanced Java Web Programming" (CS 532) of Northwestern Polytechnic University.
This project is a Based on following instruction by professor :


  The purpose of this lab is get experience using collection classes. 

  First Exercise: 
  
  Fast Customer Lookup Modify the program (GUI written for you) so that a Name search can be done or a Phone search. 
  We'll assume phone numbers are unique -- given a Phone number, there is exactly one customer. 
  However, Name searches are not unique. Given a Name, there will be a list of customers. 
  Try this first using ArrayList so you can use a data structure you are familiar with and can understand the problem better. 
  Then switch to a better data structure -- make sure you are not doing a linear search!   
    Note that you will need a different data structure for each search -- that is the price of improving the speed. 
    But the cost should still be minimal because you will not be duplicating Customer objects. 
    There should still be only one copy of each Customer. 


  Second Exercise: 
  
  Remove duplicates in a customer list This is a common problem for companies. 
  They have a list of existing customers and a list of Customers who have made recent purchases. 
  The challenge is to merge the two lists so that no Customer is listed twice. 
  A duplicate is a Customer with the same Name and same Phone number.
  Once again, you should start with an ArrayList to understand the problem. 
  Then see if you can greatly speed up the algorithm by using a different data structure. 
  Make sure you are not doing a linear search to see if a Customer is already in the list!
